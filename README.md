# One-page address book app

Basically a repo containing all the files needed to run an address book app on a website. Currently not working as intended due to submitted user data not displaying. 

-------------
Update 19/11/19: rewrote code to produce a working solution.
-------------

An app which allows users to store non-persistent data in the form of their name, address, email, phone number etc. Allows users to search for entries which they have added as well as delete entries. Written with HTML, jQuery and CSS to style the webpage. 

To-do (in order of priority): 
- Create a modify button upon search finding a match for that particular entry.
- Handle search not finding a match.
- Re-introduce house name as a challenge for me to create multiple required fields which will disable upon the user entering a valid input for just one of them (i.e. in this case if the user entered their house number in, house name would then become disabled). 
- Create a collapsible navbar.
